    <p><b>MHS Mail Setup</b></p>
    <p>If you have not already set up your MHS email on your iPad you can use this profile to simplify the process. This method is preferred to using a redirect as a problem with the redirect server may cause you to miss important emails. We strongly recommend that you use these instructions to remove your redirect and set up your mail directly on your iPad. Please note that due to a server-side issue sending emails is currently not supported.</p>
    <p>Step 1: Ensure that the mail redirect is disabled. This can be done <a href="http://admin.vicone.netspace.net.au">here.</a> Note that this only works from school.</p>
    <p>Step 2: Download this configuration profile and follow the instructions. The username is of the form abc0001@mhs.vic.edu.au and the password is the password to your email account which will still be your birthday if you haven't changed it. Note that it may take up to 2 minutes to verify the server settings, this is normal. Feel free to contact anyone in the IT Executive if you require further assistance.</p>
    <p>On iPad you will need to open this page in Safari.</p>
